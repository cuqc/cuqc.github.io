The pairing reflects the intersection of crypto innovation and traditional finance.  

### Key Characteristics:

## What Is Ethereum and Its Role in Blockchain?  

Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain platform enabling developers to build and deploy **smart contracts** and DApps. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum focuses on programmable blockchain functionality, supporting innovations like decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and Web3 infrastructure.  

### Ethereum's Core Features:  
1. **Smart Contracts**: Self-executing agreements coded into the blockchain.  
2. **Gas Fees**: Transactions require ETH to pay for computational resources.  
3. **EIP-1559 Upgrade**: Reduces token supply through periodic burns, potentially impacting ETH's value.  

**Example**: A decentralized social media platform built on Ethereum eliminates intermediaries, allowing users to monetize content directly via ETH rewards.

### Factors Influencing GBP:  
- **Interest Rates**: The BoE adjusts rates to control inflation.  
- **Trade Balances**: Export/import dynamics affect GBP's value.  
- **Geopolitical Events**: Brexit negotiations, elections, or global crises can cause fluctuations.  

**Comparison**: GBP's daily volatility averages 0.6%, starkly contrasting with ETH's 5â€“10% swings.
