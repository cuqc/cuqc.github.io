# Base L2 Approaches $3 Billion in DEX Volume, Setting a New Record  

## The Rise of Base L2 in Decentralized Finance  

**Base L2**, Coinbaseâ€™s Layer-2 blockchain solution, has achieved a significant milestone with its daily decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume nearing **$3 billion**. This record-breaking figure underscores Baseâ€™s growing influence in the blockchain ecosystem and its critical role in scaling on-chain transactions for Coinbase users.

## Strategic Focus on Utility Over Speculation  

Unlike many blockchain projects, Base operates without a native token. Coinbase has explicitly ruled out launching a token for Base, prioritizing ecosystem growth and user adoption. Jesse Pollak, Baseâ€™s lead developer, reiterated this strategy:  

> **"There are no plans for a Base network token. We are focused on building, and we want to solve real problems that let you build better."**  

This approach reduces speculative risks and attracts long-term users prioritizing utility over short-term gains.  

## Consistent Growth in Transactions and TVL  

Baseâ€™s recent achievements follow earlier milestones, including:  
- **1 billion transactions** processed two months ago.  
- **6 million daily transactions** reached in October 2024.  
- Surpassing Ethereum in user growth during 2024â€™s crypto market rebound.  

### Total Value Locked (TVL) Trends  

Baseâ€™s TVL has shown consistent growth, reflecting increased user participation and liquidity inflows. A rising TVL indicates stronger confidence in the platform, fostering a sustainable DeFi environment.  

| Metric                | Value         | Growth (YoY) |  
|-----------------------|---------------|--------------|  
| DEX Trading Volume    | $2.9 billion  | +220%        |  
| TVL                   | $2.1 billion  | +180%        |  
| Daily Transactions    | 6 million     | +150%        |
