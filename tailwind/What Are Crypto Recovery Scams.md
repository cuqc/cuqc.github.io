## Understanding Crypto Recovery Scams

**Crypto recovery scams** prey on individuals who‚Äôve lost access to their digital wallets or had assets stolen. Scammers pose as experts or legitimate companies, claiming they can retrieve lost funds through technical solutions. However, their true intent is to extract money or sensitive information before disappearing entirely.

Imagine this scenario: You‚Äôve misplaced your wallet‚Äôs seed phrase and turn to online forums for help. A seemingly knowledgeable user responds, offering to recover your funds for a fee. They use terms like ‚Äúblockchain forensics‚Äù or ‚Äúkey regeneration‚Äù to build credibility. After paying upfront, they vanish‚Äîleaving you with zero recovery and additional losses.

## How Crypto Recovery Scams Operate

Scammers employ a systematic approach to target vulnerable individuals. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of their methods:

### 1. **Identifying Victims**
   - Scammers scour social media platforms like X (Twitter), Reddit, and Telegram for posts about lost access to wallets or hacks.

### 4. **Disappearing Act**
   - After payment, scammers cut off communication or fabricate delays to extract more funds.
