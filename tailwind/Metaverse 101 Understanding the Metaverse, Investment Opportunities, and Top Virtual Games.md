# Metaverse 101: Understanding the Metaverse, Investment Opportunities, and Top Virtual Games

## What Exactly Is the Metaverse?

Imagine attending virtual concerts, collaborating in immersive workspaces, or exploring digital citiesâ€”all while staying at home. Companies like **Nike** have already created virtual spaces like Nikeland on Roblox, while **Spotify Island** demonstrates how music platforms are integrating into this ecosystem.

Key technologies driving the Metaverse include:
